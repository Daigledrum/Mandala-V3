# Mandala-V3

**Mandala-V3** is a MIDI device created for expressive performance and tight integration with the latest **Mandala Pad by Synesthesia Corp**. The device allows quick manipulation of incoming MIDI data, enabling fast changes to musical scales and note ranges directly inside Ableton Live.

In addition, Mandala-V3 supports **MIDI CC (Control Change)** messages, allowing CC data from the Mandala Pad to be mapped to parameters throughout Ableton Live. This makes it possible to control instruments, effects, and other devices using expressive pad gestures.

The device should be placed on a MIDI track before an instrument or MIDI-responsive device.
